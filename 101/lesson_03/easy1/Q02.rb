# Difference between ! and ? in Ruby
# By convention, "!" at the end of a method indicates that the method
# mutates the caller, and "?" means that the method returns a Boolean.
# However, in that context they are part of the methods' names, and
# NOT a part of Ruby sytax. Their meaning depends purely on method
# implementation.

# what is != and where should you use it?
# Means "is not equal to", and should be used when comparing values

# put ! before something, like !user_name
# Turns an object into the opposite of its Boolean equivalent

# put !! before something, like !!user_name
# Turns an object into its Boolean equivalent
