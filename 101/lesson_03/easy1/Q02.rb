# Difference between ! and ? in Ruby
# "!" can mean "not" or "mutate caller", depending on the context
# "?" indicates that a method returns a boolean

# what is != and where should you use it?
# Means "is not equal to", and should be used when comparing values

# put ! before something, like !user_name
# Means "not value"

# put ! after something, like words.uniq!
# Means "mutate the caller"

# put ? before something
# I don't know what this means...

# put ? after something
# Means this method returns a Boolean

# put !! before something, like !!user_name
# Huh. No clue...
