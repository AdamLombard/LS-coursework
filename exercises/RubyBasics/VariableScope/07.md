What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have tried to answer.
```ruby
a = 7
array = [1, 2, 3]

array.each do |element|
  a = element
end

puts a
```

`3`

Here we are dealing with a block. Blocks have access to variables defined outside the block.

`a` is assigned to `7`, `1`, `2`, and `3` in turn. By the time we get to the `puts`, `a` is `3`.
