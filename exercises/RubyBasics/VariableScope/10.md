What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have tried to answer.
```ruby
a = 7
array = [1, 2, 3]

def my_value(ary)
  ary.each do |b|
    a += b
  end
end

my_value(array)
puts a
```

---

This will raise an expection.

Methods are self-contained with respect to local variables, therefore the `a` inside the method has not been initialized prior to the operation attempted.
