What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have tried to answer.
```ruby
a = 7

def my_value(a)
  a += 10
end

my_value(a)
puts a
```

---

`7`

This problem is the same as the previous. There are two variables here at different scopes, that just happen to have the same name.
