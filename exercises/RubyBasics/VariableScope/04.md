What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have tried to answer.
```ruby
a = "Xyzzy"

def my_value(b)
  b[2] = '-'
end

my_value(a)
puts a
```

---

`Xy-zy`

The `String#[]=` method is NOT an assignment method. It mutates the location in memory. Since `a` and `b` point to the same location in memory, the mutated string will be printed.
