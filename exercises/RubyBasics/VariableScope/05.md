What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have tried to answer.
```ruby
a = "Xyzzy"

def my_value(b)
  b = 'yzzyX'
end

my_value(a)
puts a
```

---

`Xyzzy`

Here we are assigning a new value to `b`, rather than mutating the value at the location in memory to which `b` points.
